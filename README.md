# Analog

Analog is a simple logger for any events you want. It gives you a simple sessions mechanics and two ways to view events right in your app.

## Requirements
* iOS 10+

## Instalation
```sh
$ github "rosberry/Analog"
```

## Usage

All you need to log event is just to create instance of `Logger` and call `log(Event)` method.

`Event` is a class which have `title`, `parameters` and `date` properties.

All events take their places in sessions. `Session` is just a container for events with `UUID`. All sessions automatically save on disk in `Documents/Analog/Sessions` on every `willResignActiveNotification`.

If you want to view your events you can do it easily. Just present `logger.currentEventsModule()`. Also you have an ability to view all sessions by presenting `logger.sessionsModule()`. Also you can share a plain text of session with "Share" button in concrete session log screen.
